# About me

My name is Ziming Ji and I am a Master student in [Astrophysical Sciences and Technology Program](https://www.rit.edu/study/astrophysical-sciences-and-technology-phd) at the [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu) in NY USA.
My Master project focuses on the identification of [Supermassive Binary Black Holes (SMBBHs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_black_hole).
I simulate the SMBBHs simulation data using CLOUDY and analyze the output data.
